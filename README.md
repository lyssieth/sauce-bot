# sauce-bot

A bot which finds the original source of images, often referred to as 'sauce'.

## Usage

### Currently implemented

This bot uses only global slash commands.

- `/saucenao <link or attachment>` to use the [saucenao](https://saucenao.com) backend (faster but rate limited, more places searched)
  - Global (across all users) rate limits currently:
    - 30s: 6 searches
    - 24h: 200 searches
- `/fuzzysearch <link or attachment>` to use the [fuzzysearch](https://fuzzysearch.net) backend
- `/iqdb <link>` to use the [iqdb](https://iqdb.org) backend (slower but no rate limit, less places searched)
- `/invite` to get an invite link for the bot
- `/issue` to get a direct link to the issues page
- `/support` to support me as the creator, if you deem me worth it
- `/help` to provide some help.
